# 📘 Day 9 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 9 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today, I focused on one of the most important linear data structures — the Array. I also explored various searching techniques and logic-building exercises based on real-world use cases.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Arrays in Java
- Array Creation & Memory Representation
- Taking Input and Output using Loops
- Updating Elements in Arrays
- Passing Arrays as Function Arguments
- Linear Search Implementation
- Finding the Largest Element in an Array
- Binary Search in Sorted Arrays
- Reversing an Array (Two-Pointer Technique)
- Printing All Pairs in an Array
- Generating All Subarrays using Nested Loops

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Declaring and initializing arrays of different types  
- ✅ Accepting user input for arrays and printing values  
- ✅ Implementing Linear Search with dry-run  
- ✅ Finding Largest Element in an Array  
- ✅ Writing Binary Search for sorted arrays  
- ✅ Reversing array elements using two-pointer approach  
- ✅ Printing all possible pairs in an array  
- ✅ Printing all subarrays using nested loops  

These exercises helped reinforce my understanding of array traversal, index manipulation, and basic searching algorithms—critical skills for upcoming DSA topics.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (written and compiled in VS Code)
- Scanner class for input handling

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each array concept is implemented with separate `.java` files, with clear variable names, logic dry-runs, and inline comments for better readability and practice.

## 📌 Goal:
To strengthen array fundamentals, improve search logic, and build a strong base for solving array-based problems in coding interviews.
