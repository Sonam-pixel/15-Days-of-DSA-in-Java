# 📘 Day 14 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 14 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today was dedicated to revision — revisiting every concept, code, and challenge from the past 13 days. It was all about reinforcing logic, reviewing problem-solving patterns, and deepening my understanding.

## 📚 Days Revisited:
- Day 1 – Flowcharts, Pseudocode & Basic Problems  
- Day 2 – Variables, Data Types & User Input  
- Day 3 – Operators in Java  
- Day 4 – Conditional Statements  
- Day 5 – Loops and Iterations  
- Day 6 – Pattern Printing with Nested Loops  
- Day 7 – Functions and Method Design  
- Day 8 – Advanced Pattern Questions  
- Day 9 – Arrays & Searching Techniques  
- Day 10 – Array-Based Problem Solving  
- Day 11 – Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)  
- Day 12 – 2D Arrays  
- Day 13 – String and StringBuilder Operations

## 💻 Concepts Revisited & Practiced:
- Beginner to intermediate problems across all topics  
- Nested loops and complex pattern generation  
- Function decomposition and recursion  
- Sorting and searching fundamentals  
- 1D & 2D array manipulations  
- String operations: reverse, palindrome, compression, substring, compareTo  
- Type conversions and promotions  
- Time & space complexity analysis

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (compiled in VS Code)

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
You’ll find revised and optimized versions of previously written programs.  
Many tricky problems were reattempted with cleaner logic and better formatting.
