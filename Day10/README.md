# 📘 Day 10 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 10 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today’s focus was on solving advanced array problems using a range of approaches — from brute force to optimal algorithms like Prefix Sum and Kadane’s Algorithm.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Review of Array Traversal & Logic
- Max Subarray Sum – Brute Force (O(n³))
- Max Subarray Sum – Prefix Sum Optimization (O(n²))
- Max Subarray Sum – Kadane’s Algorithm (O(n))
- Tapping Rainwater Problem – Logic + Implementation
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock – One-Pass Strategy

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Max Subarray Sum using Brute Force  
- ✅ Max Subarray Sum using Prefix Sum  
- ✅ Max Subarray Sum using Kadane's Algorithm  
- ✅ Trapping Rainwater using LeftMax & RightMax arrays  
- ✅ Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (max profit)  

These are classic coding interview problems that test problem-solving depth and optimization skills. Practicing multiple approaches helped me understand time-space trade-offs.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (coded in VS Code)

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
The folder contains clean Java implementations for each problem with comments explaining logic, dry-runs, and edge case handling.  
I compared different approaches (brute force, prefix sum, Kadane’s) and explored real-world pattern recognition (stock price, rainfall bars).

## 📌 Key Takeaways:
- Array problems often have multiple approaches; optimize after understanding brute force.
- Kadane’s Algorithm and Prefix Sum are essential tools in the DSA toolkit.
- Tapping Rainwater strengthens preprocessing skills.
- Stock trading logic sharpens greedy and two-pointer intuition.
