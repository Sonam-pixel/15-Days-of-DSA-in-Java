# 📘 Day 5 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 5 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today, I dived deep into the world of **loops**—the heart of repetition and automation in programming. Understanding how loops work helps solve a wide range of problems efficiently.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Loops in Java
- while loop – print numbers from 1 to 10, 1 to n
- for loop – print square patterns
- do-while loop – menu-style input
- break & continue statements
- Prime number logic using loops
- Reversing a number using loops
- Sum of n natural numbers using loops

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Print numbers from 1 to 10 using while loop  
- ✅ Print numbers from 1 to n using user input  
- ✅ Find the sum of first n natural numbers  
- ✅ Print square pattern using for loop  
- ✅ Reverse a number (e.g., 1234 → 4321)  
- ✅ Use do-while loop to print menu until exit  
- ✅ Break from loop on a condition (e.g., stop at 5) 
- ✅ Skip even numbers using continue  
- ✅ Check if a number is prime using loop logic  

These practice problems gave me hands-on understanding of how to structure repetitive tasks and control program flow effectively.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (VS Code)
- Scanner class for input
- Loops and conditionals for logic

## 🔍 What’s Inside:
Each loop concept is demonstrated through simple and well-commented Java programs. You'll find examples for while, for, and do-while loops along with break/continue logic.

## 📌 Goal:
To master iterative logic and understand how loops help simplify complex repetitive tasks in DSA problems.
