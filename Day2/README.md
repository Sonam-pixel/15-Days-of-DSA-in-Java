# 📘 Day 2 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 2 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today, I explored the fundamental concepts of **variables**, **data types**, **user input**, and **typecasting** — all crucial for building any Java program.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Setting up a Java file with boilerplate structure
- Printing output and basic patterns in Java
- Declaring variables and understanding data types
- Writing single-line and multi-line comments
- Taking user input using the `Scanner` class
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Understanding type conversion, typecasting, and type promotion

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Sum of Two Numbers (with user input)  
- ✅ Product of Two Numbers  
- ✅ Calculate Area of a Circle (using πr²)  
- ✅ Implicit Type Conversion  
- ✅ Explicit Typecasting  
- ✅ Type Promotion in Expressions  

These tasks helped me understand how Java manages data in memory and how conversions between types happen during calculations.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (code written and compiled using VS Code)
- Scanner class for handling user input

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each concept is demonstrated using a separate `.java` file with clear code and inline comments for better understanding.  
The code includes examples of data input/output, operations, and type handling in Java.

## 📌 Goal:
To build a strong programming foundation by mastering how Java handles data and user interaction.
