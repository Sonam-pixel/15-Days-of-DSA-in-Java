# 📘 Day 11 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 11 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today was dedicated to one of the most essential algorithmic foundations — mastering different types of **Sorting Algorithms**.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- What is Sorting? Why do we need it?
- Bubble Sort – Concept & Code
- Selection Sort – Concept & Code
- Insertion Sort – Concept & Code
- Java’s Inbuilt Sort – Arrays.sort()
- Counting Sort – Concept & Code

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Manual dry runs of each sorting technique  
- ✅ Compared time and space complexities of Bubble, Selection & Insertion Sort  
- ✅ Implemented each algorithm from scratch in Java  
- ✅ Used Java’s built-in Arrays.sort() for optimized results  
- ✅ Learned Counting Sort for non-comparison-based linear sorting  
- ✅ Solved real-world style sorting problems and visualized array operations  

These practices gave me clarity on algorithm behavior, efficiency, and when to use which sorting approach based on data and constraints.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (VS Code)
- Arrays utility class for inbuilt sort
- Pen-paper dry runs for better visualization

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own .java file, with clear comments and outputs.  
There’s a comparison of when and where to use different sorts, including edge cases and real-world data examples.

## 📌 Key Takeaways:
- Bubble Sort: Simple but inefficient (O(n²))  
- Selection Sort: Stable and predictable, also O(n²)  
- Insertion Sort: Efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays  
- Arrays.sort(): Uses Dual-Pivot QuickSort — fast and reliable  
- Counting Sort: Linear time sorting for small integer ranges
