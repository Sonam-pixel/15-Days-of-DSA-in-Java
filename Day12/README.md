# 📘 Day 12 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 12 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today, I deep-dived into one of the most powerful and commonly used structures in DSA — 2D Arrays. From matrix operations to image processing, they play a key role in solving real-world problems.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Introduction to 2D Arrays & their Real-Life Use Cases  
- Declaring and Initializing 2D Arrays in Java  
- Understanding Row-Major Order (2D memory layout)  
- Nested Loops for Traversal  
- Spiral Matrix Traversal – Logic & Code  
- Diagonal Sum – Primary & Secondary  
- Optimized Search in Sorted 2D Matrix – O(n + m) Time  

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Spiral Matrix Traversal  
- ✅ Diagonal Sum (Primary + Secondary Diagonals)  
- ✅ Search in a Sorted 2D Matrix  
- ✅ Edge Case Handling for Non-Square Matrices  
- ✅ Practicing Matrix Traversals with Nested Loops  

These problems helped me strengthen my matrix visualization skills and build efficient traversal logic — critical for many DSA challenges.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (written and executed in VS Code)

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each matrix problem is implemented in separate Java files with proper comments.  
The code includes visualization tips, index tracking, and clean nested-loop structure for clarity and performance.

## 📌 Goal:
To master 2D array concepts and traversal techniques for solving grid-based problems in coding interviews and applications.
