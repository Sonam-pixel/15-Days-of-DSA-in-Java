# 📘 Day 8 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 8 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today was all about diving deep into advanced pattern problems — an exciting way to sharpen nested loop logic, dry run ability, and control flow mastery in Java.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Hollow Rectangle Pattern
- Dry Run of Hollow Rectangle Logic
- Inverted & Rotated Half Pyramid
- Inverted Half Pyramid with Numbers
- Floyd’s Triangle Pattern
- 0–1 Triangle Pattern
- Butterfly Pattern
- Solid Rhombus
- Hollow Rhombus
- Diamond Pattern

---

## 💻 Patterns Practiced:
- ✅ Hollow Rectangle using nested loops and conditionals  
- ✅ Inverted & Rotated Half Pyramid with space alignment  
- ✅ Number Pyramid with decreasing digits  
- ✅ Floyd’s Triangle using incremental counters  
- ✅ 0–1 Triangle using (i + j) % 2 logic  
- ✅ Butterfly Pattern using mirrored stars and spacing  
- ✅ Solid and Hollow Rhombus with shifting logic  
- ✅ Diamond Pattern using symmetry of pyramids  

These pattern problems helped me build strong loop logic, improve dry run visualization, and practice precise control of spacing and structure in output formatting.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (written and executed in VS Code)

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each pattern is implemented in a separate `.java` file with proper naming and comments for clarity.  
The code includes logic breakdowns and dry run-ready formatting for better understanding.

## 📌 Goal:
To boost problem-solving skills using visual logic problems and enhance comfort with nested loops and spacing control.
