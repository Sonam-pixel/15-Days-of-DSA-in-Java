# 📘 Day 15 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to the final day of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🏁  
Today was dedicated to wrapping things up with a complete revision — reviewing all the topics, retesting key code snippets, and cleaning up my GitHub project.

---

## 📚 Topics Revisited:
- Variables, Data Types, Input/Output
- Operators, Conditionals, and Loops
- Nested Loops & Pattern Printing
- Functions, Recursion & Logic Building
- Arrays (1D & 2D), Searching & Sorting
- Strings, StringBuilder & String Manipulation

---

## 💻 Final Tasks Completed:
- ✅ Revised all DSA problems & notes
- ✅ Rewrote core logic from scratch (without looking)
- ✅ Cleaned and organized GitHub repository

This final revision helped me solidify everything I’ve learned — from simple conditionals to solving with recursion and arrays. It also gave me the confidence to approach coding interviews with clarity and structure.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (coded and tested using VS Code)
- GitHub for version control & project showcase

## 📌 Reflection:
This challenge helped me build strong fundamentals in Java, debug confidently, and solve problems in a structured way. It's the end of this sprint — but just the beginning of many more projects, learning streaks, and interview prep challenges ahead.
