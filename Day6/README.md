# 📘 Day 6 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 6 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today’s focus was on mastering pattern printing using nested loops—an essential technique for building logic and practicing control flow, especially useful in interviews.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Nested Loops
- Square Star Pattern
- Inverted Star Pattern
- Right-Angled Triangle Pattern
- Half-Pyramid using *
- Character-Based Patterns
- Number Pattern Basics
- Dry Run to Trace Loop Flow

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Print a square star pattern (e.g., 4x4)  
- ✅ Print a right-angled triangle star pattern  
- ✅ Print an inverted triangle using stars  
- ✅ Print a half-pyramid pattern with numbers  
- ✅ Print a character pattern  
- ✅ Print a triangle where numbers increase row-wise  
- ✅ Practiced nested for loops  
- ✅ Dry-ran patterns to understand row-column logic  

These problems helped improve my understanding of loop nesting and how to control structure and layout using indexes.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (code written and compiled in VS Code)

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each pattern is solved in a separate, well-commented `.java` file.  
The logic is explained step-by-step with example outputs to make learning easier.

## 📌 Goal:
To gain confidence with nested loops and pattern logic that lays the groundwork for more advanced topics like 2D arrays and recursion.
