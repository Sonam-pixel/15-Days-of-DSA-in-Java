# 📘 Day 3 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 3 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today, I focused on understanding how **operators** work in Java — an essential concept for writing effective logic, expressions, and conditions in programming.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Types of Operators in Java
- Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Unary Operators (`++`, `--`, `+`, `-`, `!`)
- Relational Operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`)

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Using arithmetic operations in expressions  
- ✅ Understanding prefix vs postfix increment/decrement  
- ✅ Evaluating relational and comparison conditions  
- ✅ Building logical conditions for decision-making  
- ✅ Combining multiple operators in real-world-style problems  
- ✅ Quick practice problems using all types of operators  

These exercises helped me get comfortable with writing and evaluating Java expressions — a foundation for upcoming control structures and algorithms.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (coded and tested using VS Code)

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each type of operator is demonstrated through simple, well-commented Java programs.  
Includes practical examples of how operators behave during execution and interact with different data types.

## 📌 Goal:
To master operator behavior in Java and sharpen my logical thinking for writing efficient conditions and expressions.
