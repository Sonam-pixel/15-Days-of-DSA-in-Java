# 📘 Day 7 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 7 of my 15-day journey to master Data Structures & Algorithms in Java! 🚀  
Today’s focus was on mastering Functions and Methods — the core building blocks for modular and reusable Java programs.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Functions and Java Syntax
- Functions with Parameters & Return Types
- Parameters vs. Arguments
- Call Stack Basics & Function Memory Flow
- Java’s Call by Value Mechanism
- In-built vs. User-Defined Methods
- Function Overloading (by parameter count & data type)
- Scope: Method Scope vs. Block Scope

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Product of Two Numbers (using a function)  
- ✅ Factorial Calculation using Methods  
- ✅ Binomial Coefficient using Factorial Function  
- ✅ Function Overloading with different parameter counts  
- ✅ Function Overloading with different data types  
- ✅ Prime Number Checker  
- ✅ Optimized Prime Check using √n approach  
- ✅ Print All Primes in a Given Range  
- ✅ Binary to Decimal Conversion  
- ✅ Decimal to Binary Conversion  
- ✅ Scope Exploration with Nested Functions and Blocks  

These problems reinforced the importance of clean function structure and memory flow while introducing basic polymorphism with overloading.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (coded and tested in VS Code)

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each concept is implemented as a clean and modular Java file with comments.  
Special focus on reusable methods, input/output handling, and clear function naming for readability.

## 📌 Goal:
To build logical thinking by mastering modular code using methods and understand how memory and scopes work behind the scenes.
