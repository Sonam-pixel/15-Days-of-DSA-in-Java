# 📘 Day 13 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 13 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today was dedicated to one of the most versatile and interview-relevant data types — Strings in Java.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- What are Strings? (Immutable sequences of characters)
- String input/output using Scanner
- length(), concat(), charAt(), substring()
- String comparison using compareTo()
- Palindrome check logic
- Shortest path from directions (N, S, E, W)
- Lexicographical string comparison
- Finding the largest string in a list
- StringBuilder usage for efficient edits
- ASCII-based uppercase conversion
- String compression (Run-length encoding style)
- Why Strings are immutable in Java

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Took user input with nextLine()  
- ✅ Checked palindromes using charAt()  
- ✅ Parsed and converted directions into shortest X-Y path  
- ✅ Compared strings lexicographically  
- ✅ Extracted substrings from strings  
- ✅ Found the lexicographically largest string  
- ✅ Converted characters to uppercase using ASCII  
- ✅ Performed string compression using loops and conditions

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (VS Code)
- Scanner class
- StringBuilder

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each concept is demonstrated using separate, well-commented Java programs.  
Special focus was given to immutability, character-wise manipulation, and efficient string building with StringBuilder.

## 📌 Goal:
To build a strong grasp of string manipulation, indexing, comparison, and memory management — a must-have for interview and real-world coding.
