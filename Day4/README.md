# 📘 Day 4 - #15DaysOfDSAinJava

Welcome to Day 4 of my 15-day journey to master **Data Structures & Algorithms in Java**! 🚀  
Today, I explored one of the most powerful tools in any programming language — conditional statements. They help us control the flow of the program based on logic and conditions, making our code intelligent and responsive.

## 📚 Topics Covered:
- if and else statements  
- else if ladder  
- Ternary operator (`? :`)  
- switch statement  

---

## 💻 Problems Practiced:
- ✅ Print the largest of two numbers using if-else  
- ✅ Check whether a number is odd or even  
- ✅ Create an Income Tax Calculator using else if  
- ✅ Find the largest of three numbers  
- ✅ Use ternary operator to check if a student will pass or fail  
- ✅ Implement a basic calculator using switch-case  

These problems helped me develop strong logical branching techniques and laid the foundation for tackling complex decision-based problems in DSA.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Java (coded and tested using VS Code)

---

## 🔍 What's Inside:
Each program demonstrates a different conditional structure in Java, with clean and readable code and comments.  
Great for beginners trying to master control flow and decision-making in Java.

## 📌 Goal:
To become comfortable with Java’s conditional statements and understand how to handle different flows based on dynamic input or logic.
